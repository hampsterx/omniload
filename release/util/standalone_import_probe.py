Probe whether `dlt_filesystem` imports on the dependency set a standalone
distribution would carry: `dlt` plus the `[filesystem]` extra's own members
(with their transitive dependencies), and nothing else from omniload.

A full `pip install 'omniload[filesystem]'` cannot answer this. An extra is
additive to base dependencies, so that install always supplies the base list by
accident and every undeclared import in the package goes green. This is the only
check in the tree that would notice a new one before the extraction does.

Two assertions, deliberately of different strength:

  1. HARD  -- `import dlt_filesystem.source.core`, the source entry point, must
     succeed. Anything it reaches is a real dependency of the package.
  2. SWEEP -- every module in the package is force-imported and the failures
     reported. A module may import something heavy at its own top level
     *because it is itself imported lazily*; that costs nothing at startup and
     is not a defect, so those are exempted in ALLOWED_MISSING with the reason.
     Anything else fails. Only a `ModuleNotFoundError` can be exempted: an
     installed module whose symbol is missing raises a plain `ImportError`
     carrying the same `name`, and exempting on the name alone would swallow a
     genuinely broken import inside the exempted module.

Each assertion runs in its own ephemeral environment built by `uv run
--isolated --no-config`, holding that dependency set and nothing else. Neither
flag is belt and braces. A `dependency-metadata` entry in an ambient `uv.toml`
can declare that some installed package requires the very name the extra omits,
and `--isolated` does not stop uv reading configuration; `--no-config` stops a
discovered file, and an explicit `UV_CONFIG_FILE` outranks it (measured on uv
0.9.26). So the environment is refused rather than cleaned: any `UV_*` variable
the probe cannot vouch for and it declines to run. Dropping them would be its
own answer rather than a neutral one, because an index variable names where a
distribution comes from, and removing it can resolve the same name off PyPI with
different transitive dependencies and no error at all. The refusal is
deliberately wider than the set that can actually change an install, since
sorting the inert ones from the rest is the judgement it is declining to make.
The one exemption is `UV_RUN_RECURSION_DEPTH`, which `uv run` sets on everything
it starts and which would otherwise refuse this program's own `uv run --script`
form.

Only `dlt_filesystem` is put on the path, through a staging directory holding a
link to it alone, so an `import omniload...` from inside the package fails here
exactly as it would after extraction. The interpreter runs isolated (`-I`) so an
inherited PYTHONPATH cannot supply a dependency the set omits, and under its own
`pycache_prefix` so the real tree's `__pycache__` can neither be written to nor
read from. That last one is not tidiness: a same-size edit with an unchanged
mtime is served from a stale `.pyc`, so the broken source is never read and the
probe passes over it.

Every member of the extra is validated as a requirement and then written out
verbatim. Validation is needed because a requirements file is a script rather
than a list: a member reading `-r /elsewhere.txt` is an instruction uv honours,
a bare `x.tar.gz` is a local archive it installs from the working directory, and
a TOML table degrades to its keys under `list()`. Writing the original back out
is needed because re-serialising a parse re-quotes an environment marker, and a
marker whose literal contains the other quote character then means something
else (measured on packaging 26.0).

Every assertion has to both exit zero and say it finished, and it says so on a
dedicated file descriptor rather than in its own output. Neither half is
redundant. An exit status alone cannot carry completion: the entry assertion
imports without a handler, so a module raising `SystemExit(0)` there ends the
interpreter with status 0 having printed nothing, and `os._exit(0)` does it from
anywhere, the sweep included, without raising at all. (The sweep does catch
`SystemExit`, per module, which is what lets it keep going and report the rest.)
A token in
ordinary output cannot carry provenance either: a module that prints the token
and then calls `os._exit(0)` forges it, and stdout and stderr are both reachable
from any module being imported. The descriptor is marked non-inheritable before the
package is touched, so a subprocess started at import time cannot write stray
bytes into the evidence either. What remains is code that writes to that
descriptor in this process, or forks rather than execs; nothing in-process rules
that out, and it is not what an accident looks like.

What it does not check: this imports from the source tree, so it says nothing
about a built wheel's metadata or packaged contents. Nor can an import sweep see
a lazy runtime import, a `try: import x except ImportError` that swallows a
missing dependency at module top, or a direct dependency that some other
requirement happens to supply transitively. There is no timeout either, so a
module that blocks at import hangs the probe rather than failing it. And it
takes `pyproject.toml` at its word once the file parses: a declaration that is
well formed and wrong is the answer it gives.

POSIX only. The completion evidence rides an inherited file descriptor, and
`subprocess`'s `pass_fds` has no Windows equivalent.

Usage:
    python release/util/standalone_import_probe.py [--keep] [--python 3.13]
    uv run --script release/util/standalone_import_probe.py

The second form needs no environment of its own: the script metadata above
declares what reading `pyproject.toml` costs, and uv supplies it. This file is
also its own child, re-entered in place with `--child`; `-I` keeps its directory
off `sys.path` at every version the project supports.

Exit status:
    0  the package imports on its own dependency set
    1  it does not, and the output says which module reached for what
    2  this program could not answer: it could not read `pyproject.toml`, or
       could not stage or walk the tree, or the environment is one it declines
       to guess about
