"""The two distributions this repository builds have to stay a matched pair.

`omniload` depends on `dlt-filesystem` without a version specifier, and that is a
measured decision rather than an omission. Two things make a pin unenforceable here:

- The versions are computed by versioningit from the git tag at build time, so an
  exact one cannot be written into a static `dependencies` list at all.
- A specifier on a workspace member is not checked locally. `uv pip compile` resolves
  `dlt-filesystem==99.0.0` against the local tree and exits 0, so a wrong pin would
  reach PyPI with every local check green.

What "lockstep" claims is that one tag produces one version for both projects. That is
asserted here at its cause, the two `[tool.versioningit]` declarations, rather than by
comparing installed versions: an installed version records the commit each project was
*installed* at, so two editable installs made at different commits differ without
anything being wrong.
