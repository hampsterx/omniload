"""``--reshape`` over a SQL source, which is where the item shape bites.

SQL defaults to the ``pyarrow`` backend (``api.py`` promotes ``SqlBackend.default``),
so the extract pipe carries ``pyarrow.Table`` items rather than dicts. dlt's
``MapItem`` enumerates a Python list and passes anything else through whole, so a
per-row reshape wired with ``add_map`` would receive one Table where its contract
says one document, and a jq reshape would then fail inside ``_to_jsonish``.

Mock-only unit lane (no Docker, no credentials): a real ``sqlite://`` source loads
into a real embedded duckdb, and the assertion is on the rows that land.
